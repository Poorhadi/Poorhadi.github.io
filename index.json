The system aims at controlling trains’ movement by using as few trackside devices as possible and relying on direct communication with trains. Radio-block centers (RBC) are deployed to deliver signals to trains and receive feedback. Each RBC controls the movement of the trains along a certain area by either authorizing them to move at a certain speed or stopping them. RBC sends to a train, passing through its area, a movement authority – a message containing among others danger point and end of the movement authority (EoA). A train is not allowed to pass its EoA to avoid hazardous situations. However, depending on the implementation, a safety margin might define a danger point to be beyond EoA. Therefore, the safety property usually is defined in terms of not passing the danger point, although, according to the definition, the train must not pass its EoA. In this project, we prove the safety property while the communication channel between the train and RBC is under attack.\nWe consider an attacker who performs a two-phase attack. First, she injects a valid movement authority message to set the value of EoA beyond the danger point defined by RBC. Such an attack constitutes a direct safety hazard since the EOA set by the attacker could be at the rear end of another train. Therefore, the train accepts the forged message. In the second phase, the attacker actively monitors train-RBC communication and takes some actions e.g., dropping a message to prevent the detection of the attack and stopping the train before passing the intended EoA.\nWe model and analyze the communication between RBC and the train to derive necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee safety in the presence of the attacker.\n","date":1669507200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669507200,"objectID":"e2239a03785852aaf3622e29defb047b","permalink":"https://example.com/project/project/formal-modeling-of-moving-block-signaling-system/","publishdate":"2022-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project/formal-modeling-of-moving-block-signaling-system/","section":"project","summary":"We provide a formal model of a part of ERTMS/ETCS moving block level 3 for safety analysis in the presence of cyber attacks.","tags":["Event-B","Moving block","Railway Signaling","SysML","Railway Safety","Railway Secuirty"],"title":"Formal modeling of moving block signaling system","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"EBSysMLSec is a translation tool that takes a SysML model as an input and generates the corresponding Event-B model.

The communication infrastructures that they rely on are increasingly based on standardized protocols and are shared with other users. As a result, it has an increased attack surface and is more likely to become the target of cyber attacks that can result in loss of availability and, in the worst case, in safety incidents. While formal modeling of safety properties has a well-established methodology in the railway domain, the consideration of security vulnerabilities and the related threats lacks a framework that would allow a formal treatment. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework for the analysis of the potential of security vulnerabilities to jeopardize safety in communications-based train control for railway signaling, focusing on the recently introduced moving block system. We propose a refinement-based approach enabling a structured and rigorous analysis of the impact of security on system safety.","tags":["railway safety","Event-B","formal modelling"],"title":"Formal modelling of the impact of cyber attacks on railway safety","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project was a part of formal methods course at KTH.\nWe use the WP plugin of Frama-C to formally verify a C program controlling an anti-lock braking system (ABS) of a car.
