      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was a part of formal methods course at KTH. We
Make models in NuSMV of a transmitter and the device driver control
ling the transmitter. We then express some properties in CTL and check whether the NuSMV model satisfies them. One example of such a check is to verify that the device
driver does not configure the transmitter into an unknown state where
the behavior of the transmitter is not specified. If the transmitter
enters such a state, it could do anything, e.g. transmitting confidential
data in memory. We check more than 10 properties in this project.&lt;/p&gt;
